Description: Our final project is a planner designed to help students better organize their time and be prepared for each day. Through the planner, the user is able to add events, edit events and remove events from days in any month or year. The events are automatically written to the user.text file as changes are made thus, the data remains saved even when the program stops running.

Information on how to run code: To use code, input year and click 'Show Calendar', then click on month and day inside month to add, edit, or remove an event on that day. The event will be saved to dictionary and user.txt automatically. Format for inputing date: month/day/year. No specifications for other inputs. 

Bugs: We do not have any known bugs in our bugs in our program. The user.txt file has added lines in between each event. This does not effect the functionality of the program. 

The calendar and tkinter module both come preinstalled with Python.
